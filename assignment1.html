                            In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole, in practice the
                            first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House
                            of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart. The Jacobites were finally
                            defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were
                            forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs. The British
                            colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United
                            States, recognised by Britain in 1783. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly
                            to India ...

                            Settlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves
                            beginning by about 30,000 years ago. By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is
                            thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain
                            and Gaelic Ireland. The Roman conquest, beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain, was
                            followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly to what was
                            to become Wales ...

                            The UK was one of the Big Three powers (along with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to
                            plan the post-war world;[102] it was an original signatory to the Declaration by United Nations and
                            became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. It worked closely
                            with the United States to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO.[103] The war left the UK severely
                            weakened and financially dependent on the Marshall Plan,[104] but it was spared the total war that
                            devastated eastern Europe ...

                            The UK broadly supported the United States' approach to the "war on terror" in the early
                            21st century.[120] British troops fought in the War in Afghanistan, but controversy surrounded
                            Britain's military deployment in Iraq, which saw the largest protest in British history demonstrating
                            in opposition to the government led by Tony Blair.[121] The 2008 global financial crisis
                            severely affected the UK economy.[122] The Cameron–Clegg coalition
                            government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public
                            deficits ...
